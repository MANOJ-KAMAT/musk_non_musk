# musk_non_musk
The given dataset contains details about organic chemical compounds including their chemical features, isomeric conformation, names and the classes in which they are classified. The compounds are classified as either ‘Musk’ or ‘Non-Musk’ compounds. My task was to build a classification model on the given data using any Deep Learning approach that you deem appropriate viz. Perceptron, Deep Neural Network, MP Neuron.
